# Vidneo Xala

This README will help you setup and run the project, learn about structure and architecture

### Environments

Environments will vary based on other API endpoints and configurations.

Available environments:
- `prod`
- `staging`

### Project structure

---

- `packages/common` – shared library published as `@xala/common`
- `src` – web application source code

### How do I get set up?

---

1. Clone this repository
2. `yarn install`

### If something went wrong...

---

If project broke, or other PR has added some new dependencies

You can run command **_yarn clean_** in root directory to remove all dist and build production files, as well as all node\*modules  
And try again install all dependencies using command `yarn install`

### Versioning and commit message guidelines

#### Packages

- @xala/web
- @xala/common

#### Version format

Version is defined as package name and version number in format: `MAJOR`.`MINOR`.`PATCH`.

Example: `@xala/web@1.2.3`

Package name is taken from `package.json` file. version number is determined based on existing git tag and commit message guidelines.

#### Commit message guidelines

We have rules over how our Git commit messages must be formatted.

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
  │       │             │
  │       │             └─⫸ Summary in present tense. Not capitalized. No period at the end.
  │       │
  │       └─⫸ Commit Scope: JIRA ticket ID
  │
  └─⫸ Commit Type: build|ci|docs|feat|fix|perf|refactor
```

In addition, message can contain information about breaking changes.

#### Increment PATCH version

Use one of as `type`:

- `fix` - fixes
- `perf` - optimization
- `ci` - ci configuration changes
- `build` - build changes
- `docs` - documentation
- `refactor` - code refactor

Example: `ci(VX-123): add semantic version`

#### Increment MINOR version

Use `feat` as `type`, example: `feat(VX-124): support new payment version`

#### Increment MAJOR version

Use `BREAKING CHANGE` or `BREAKING CHANGES` block and the end of commit message.

Example:

```
feat(VX-125): add user profile
BREAKING CHANGE: requires new backend API
```

#### Generate new version

Version can be generated by:

- **automatic**: merge changes to `main` branch. Bitrise will run versioning flow.
- **manual**: checkout to `main` branch and execute `yarn run release:version` - this will require JIRA connection env values to work
